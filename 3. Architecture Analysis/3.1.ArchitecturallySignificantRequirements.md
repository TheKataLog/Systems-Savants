MonitorMe will provide the ability to upload holistic snapshots of a patient's consolidated vital signs at any time to then upload them into MyMedicalData.

### 3. Profile customization

MonitorMe users can customize patients vital sign threshold settings so that vital sign devices data analysis can be adjusted for each patient.

### 4. Third party Integrations
