# Constraints

1. Cost:
* Implementing and maintaining a complex system like MonitorMe can be expensive due to hardware, software, personnel, and infrastructure needs. Finding a balance between functionality and affordability is crucial.
* Scalability costs: Expanding to accommodate more patients and devices might require significant investments in additional resources.

2. Regulatory Compliance:
* MonitorMe must comply with various healthcare data privacy and security regulations like HIPAA, which can impose limitations on data storage, access, and usage.
* Ongoing changes in regulations require adaptability and constant review of compliance practices.

3. Ethical Considerations:
* Using AI and algorithms for patient monitoring raises ethical concerns about bias, transparency, and potential discrimination. Transparency in data collection, analysis, and decision-making is crucial.
* Informed consent and patient privacy need to be carefully addressed to ensure ethical data utilization.

4. Device Interoperability:
* Currently, the focus might be on StayHealthy devices, but future integration with diverse medical devices with varying data formats and communication protocols might pose challenges.
* Standardizing data formats and ensuring seamless interoperability can be complex and require collaboration across the healthcare industry.

5. Data Quality and Integrity:
* The accuracy of alerts and analysis heavily relies on the quality of data received from devices. Ensuring data integrity throughout the system is crucial.
* Factors like device calibration, data transmission errors, and missing data need to be addressed for reliable outcomes.

6. Human Factors:
* Healthcare professionals need proper training and ongoing support to effectively utilize and interpret information provided by MonitorMe.
* Alert fatigue and potential overreliance on the system can be risks, requiring clear guidelines and responsible use practices.

7. Security and Privacy:
* Protecting sensitive patient data from cyberattacks and unauthorized access is paramount. Robust security measures, encryption, and access control are essential.
* Regularly updating security protocols and monitoring system vulnerabilities are ongoing requirements.

8. Technology Limitations:
* AI algorithms might not be perfect, and potential biases or limitations need to be considered to avoid erroneous interpretations or missed critical events.
* Continuous innovation and adaptation of the system with evolving technologies and evolving patient needs are important.

9. The initial architecture in this repository must be completed by midnight US Eastern Time, 22nd February 2024.

# Assumptions

1. Technical Assumptions:
* Reliable network connectivity: Continuous and stable internet connection is crucial for data transmission and system operation.
* Standardized medical devices: MonitorMe might assume compatibility with standardized data formats and protocols used by most medical devices.
* Adequate computing resources: The system needs sufficient computational power and storage to handle real-time processing and data storage for all patients and devices.
* Availability of skilled IT personnel: Maintaining and operating the system efficiently requires skilled IT staff.

2. User Assumptions:
