# 005 - Telemetry and Observability With Elastic and Kibana

Date: 2024-02-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Monitoring practices rely on various tools and services to collect, analyze, and present data insights. These can be used for insights to identify vulnerabilities and issues, predict performance, and optimize configurations. This includes a dedicated health check for services.

## Decision

For monitoring and logging, Elastic stack will be utilized with Kibana as a single pane view of the system performane metrics. 

## Consequences
Identify vulnerabilities and issues, predict performance, and optimize configurations.

**Positive:**

- Faster troubleshooting
- Maintain SLA/SLO for high-availability, resiliency, fault-tolerance, etc.
