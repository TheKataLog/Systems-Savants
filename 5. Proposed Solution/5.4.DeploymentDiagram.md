## Deployment Diagram [Hybrid/Private Cloud using On-premises AWS Outposts Servers]

The deployment model provides as high-level overview of the infrastructure used in the solution.

![Deployment/Infrastructure Architecture](../assets/Diagrams/MonitorMe_Deployment_Diagram.png)

**List of Infrastructure Components**

**1. Compute Resources**
Application/Web Servers: EC2 Host the web application of MonitorMe, including monitoring and alert generation, and for the Nurse Station Web Application. 

**2. Storage Systems**
Database: AWS RDS PostgreSQL Store patient data, health metrics, user information, and system logs.

**3. Networking Components**
Load Balancers: Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and high availability. Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) can be used to automatically adjust capacity according to incoming application or network traffic.

API Gateway: Ambassador API Gateway is used for managing and securing communication between MonitorMeâ€™s microservices and external interfaces. It is also used as an integration interface given the integration requirement with MyMedicalData is via secure HTTP, which an API Gateway can provide.

**4. Security Infrastructure**
Firewalls and VPNs: Protect the network perimeter and secure data transmission channels. 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) System: Hospital and MonitorMe's IAM will be used.

**5. Monitoring and Management Tools**
Solutions like Elasticsearch and Kibana (EFK stack) aggregate logs from all components of the system, facilitating troubleshooting and operational monitoring.

**6. Data Processing & IoT Messaing Infrastructure**
For real-time performance and processing of vital events, HiveMQ MQTT broker is used. HiveMQ MQTT is a Platform For Fast And Efficient Movement Of IoT Data.

**7. Backup and Disaster Recovery**
Backup Solutions: Provided via AWS RDS PostgreSQL. This can include database snapshots, file storage backups, and configuration data.
Disaster Recovery: High Availability considered, but disaster recovery options limited due to the requirement of deploying the solution to on-premises hospital locations. DR relies on hospital infrastructure.

**8. Hybrid Cloud Components - AWS Outposts Servers**
For deployments extending cloud services to on-premises environments, ensuring a consistent hybrid experience across cloud and local infrastructure.

**9. Containerization Infrastructure**
For containerization, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is used with a control plane and two node setup in a high availability and autoscale setup.
